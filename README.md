Note Taker

The goal of this assignment was to add backend functionality the source code. The website was already fully functional on the front end, I just had to plug code into the backend to make it save notes and otherwise function as intended 

### Prerequisites

In order to use the Note Taker, you'll need a device with internet connection, and a browser.

## Getting Started

As you can see I've deployed a live site so you can see what the site looks like now. 

Upon initially loading in to the site you will see this:

After clicking on the "Get Started" button you will be presented with a screen that looks like this:

From here you can click on one of the text fields to start adding notes

Once you've typed something in both the text fields, you will see save button pop up.

Click this button when you're ready to save your note.

Once you've saved a not you will see your note be saved and added to the sidebar.

Now you can click on the note you saved to see the text of the note again, or you can hit the delete icon to remove the note. 

While you're viewing a previously saved note, if you'd like to get back to typing another new note, you can hit this + icon:
